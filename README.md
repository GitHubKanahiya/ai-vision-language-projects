## 🌐 What’s Inside?

This repository includes multiple standalone projects combining vision and language AI capabilities — such as:

- 📷 Image Understanding & Processing  
- 🧠 Natural Language Interpretation  
- 🎙️ Audio Transcription & Summarization  
- 📄 Text Structuring & Classification  
- 🔄 Multimodal AI Integration  

Each project is self-contained, modular, and optimized for quick testing, learning, and deployment.
