A visualization tool that displays the chronological output of multi-agent collaboration (e.g., research, summarization, counterpoints, insights) over time. This project extends the AthenaCore system by adding a **timeline-based UI** for better tracking and analysis of agent contributions.

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Visualize how each AI agent contributes to a topic.
- Show agent outputs with timestamps in a clean, scrollable timeline.
- Group content by agent and topic.
- Enable export of visual timelines as PDF or PNG (optional).

---

## 🧩 Features

- ⏱ **Timestamps** added to every agent log entry.
- 🧠 **Grouped by Topic & Agent** for contextual clarity.
- 🧾 **Timeline View** using visual cards.
- 📤 **Exportable Timeline** (PDF/PNG) – *optional enhancement*.
- 📁 **Persistent Memory** using TinyDB (`memory_store.json`).

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install streamlit tinydb matplotlib fpdf


Optional (if using Whisper/LLM):
pip install openai-whisper

2. Run LLM Backend
ollama run llama2

3. Launch the Timeline UI
streamlit run timeline_view.py


🧠 How It Works
Each agent logs its response with:

Agent Name

Output Content

Timestamp

Topic Context

These logs are stored in memory/memory_store.json.

The frontend (timeline_view.py) reads this memory, groups messages by topic and agent, and renders a visual timeline.

Optionally, export the full timeline as PDF or PNG via export utilities.

🧰 Optional: Export Timeline
To enable PDF/PNG export, use utils/export_utils.py and integrate a download button in timeline_view.py using st.download_button.

📎 Sample Use Cases
Tracking long-term collaboration between research agents.

Visualizing AI thought evolution on strategic topics (e.g., “AI and Global Regulation”).

Archiving agent-generated insights for reporting.

🔒 Requirements

streamlit
tinydb
matplotlib
fpdf
👥 Credits
Built as part of the AthenaCore system, extending capabilities for memory-rich, multi-agent strategic AI collaboration.
